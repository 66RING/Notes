简单句障碍
============

## 定语后置句

如

```
the artist privileged to visit the gallery
```

tips:

- 看成定语从句：

```
the artist who is privileged to visit the gallery
a book useful for the future = a book which is useful for the future
```


## 同位语

形如

```
A, xxxx, is....
A or B
A of xxxx
```

同位语为了对其前面的名词说明，去掉不影响完整性。

tips

- 同位语提前
	* `the history of A or B can be divided ... = A B, 他的历史可以分为...`
- 用"即"代替


## 插入语

让表达更多样，更地道

tips

- 跳读


## 状语

tips

- 从句子中剥离
	* `a established in XXX the idea = a established idea in XXX`
		+ **难点**：`established`及物动词，不和介词搭配
	* `they maintain with a certain fidelity the principle of this school`
		+ **难点**：`maintain`不和with搭配
	* **分不清怎搭配时，都搭配着试一遍**

eg.

```
He has elected as his primary duty and pleasure in life the activity of thinking in a Scoratic wat about moral problems.
He has elected as (his primary duty and pleasure in life) (the activity of thinking in a Scoratic wat about moral problems).
elect as B A = elect A as B
```

## Summary

- 重排状语
- 踢同位语
- 跳插入语
